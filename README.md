My masters thesis project with the name "Model-based security analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems" at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics made me explore the possibilities of potentially automatize the derivation of models that can be used for cybersecurity analysis from already existent models that are used in the automotive industry.

This project is a simple solution for papyrus based models. This project holds a (i) UML profile made for cybersecurity, (ii) a simplified model containing a (ab)use case diagram and a component diagram, (iii) a code generator made using Acceleo, that generate a threat model that will be used by the security analysis tool (https://github.com/csedome/apE) that is also developed as part of my thesis project.

## Cybersecurity profile

## Abuse case diagram

## Component diagram

## Code generation and model transformation
